		  <p>The ZMap Project is a collection of open source tools for
		  performing large-scale studies of hosts and services on the Internet.
		  The project was started in 2013 with the release of ZMap, a fast
		  single-packet scanner that enabled scanning the entire public IPv4
		  address space on a single port in under 45 minutes. A year later, we
		  released ZGrab, a Go application-layer scanner that works in tandem
		  with ZMap. Since then, the team has expanded and we have built nearly
		  a dozen open source tools and libraries for performing large-scale
		  Internet measurements. Continued development is supported by the
			 National Science Foundation (NSF). The core team can be reached at
			 <a href="mailto:team@zmap.io">team@zmap.io</a>.</p>

          <p class="last">We have published several papers that describe how the suite of ZMap tools are architected:</p>

              <p class="abstract">Internet-wide network scanning has numerous
              security applications, including exposing new vulnerabilities and
              tracking the adoption of defensive mechanisms, but probing the
              entire public address space with existing tools is both difficult
              and slow. We introduce ZMap, a modular, open-source network scanner
              specifically architected to perform Internet-wide scans and capable
              of surveying the entire IPv4 address space in under 45 minutes from
              user space on a single machine, approaching the theoretical maximum
              speed of gigabit Ethernet. We present the scanner architecture,
              experimentally characterize its performance and accuracy, and
              explore the security implications of high speed Internet-scale
              network surveys, both offensive and defensive. We also discuss best
              practices for good Internet citizenship when performing
              Internet-wide surveys, informed by our own experiences conducting a
              long-term research survey over the past year.</p>

			  <p class="abstract">Active DNS measurement is fundamental to
			  understanding and im- proving the DNS ecosystem. However, the
			  absence of an extensible, high-performance, and easy-to-use DNS
			  toolkit has limited both the reproducibility and coverage of DNS
			  research. In this paper, we introduce ZDNS, a modular and
			  open-source active DNS measure- ment framework optimized for
			  large-scale research studies of DNS on the public Internet. We
			  describe ZDNS’s architecture, evaluate its performance, and
			  present two case studies that highlight how the tool can be used
			  to shed light on the operational complexities of DNS. We hope
			  that ZDNS will enable researchers to better—and in a more
			  reproducible manner—understand Internet behavior.</p>

              <p class="abstract">Over the past 20 years, websites have grown increasingly complex
              and interconnected. In 2016, only a negligible number of sites are
              dependency free, and over 90% of sites rely on external content.
              In this paper, we investigate the current state of web dependencies
              and explore two security challenges associated with the increasing
              reliance on external services: (1) the expanded attack surface associated
              with serving unknown, implicitly trusted third-party content,
              and (2) how the increased set of external dependencies impacts
              HTTPS adoption. We hope that by shedding light on these issues,
              we can encourage developers to consider the security risks associated
              with serving third-party content and prompt service providers
              to more widely deploy HTTPS.</p>

              <p>Liz Izhikevich, Renata Teixeira, and Zakir Durumeric<br/>
              USENIX Security Symposium, August 2021</p>

			  <p class="abstract">Internet-wide scanning is a commonly used
			  research tech- nique that has helped uncover real-world attacks,
			  find crypto- graphic weaknesses, and understand both operator and
			  mis- creant behavior. Studies that employ scanning have largely
			  assumed that services are hosted on their IANA-assigned ports,
			  overlooking the study of services on unusual ports. In this work,
			  we investigate where Internet services are deployed in practice
			  and evaluate the security posture of services on unexpected
			  ports. We show protocol deployment is more dif- fuse than
			  previously believed and that protocols run on many additional
			  ports beyond their primary IANA-assigned port. For example, only
			  3% of HTTP and 6% of TLS services run on ports 80 and 443,
			  respectively. Services on non-standard ports are more likely to
			  be insecure, which results in studies dramatically
			  underestimating the security posture of Inter- net hosts.
			  Building on our observations, we introduce LZR (“Laser”), a
			  system that identifies 99% of identifiable unex- pected services
			  in five handshakes and dramatically reduces the time needed to
			  perform application-layer scans on ports with few responsive
			  expected services (e.g., 5500% speedup on 27017/MongoDB). We
			  conclude with recommendations for future studies.</p>

              <p>David Adrian, Zakir Durumeric, Gulshan Singh, and J. Alex Halderman<br/>
              USENIX Workshop on Offensive Technologies (WOOT), August 2014</p>

              <p class="abstract">We introduce optimizations to the ZMap network
              scanner that achieve a 10-fold increase in maximum scan rate. By
              parallelizing address generation, introducing an improved
              blacklisting algorithm, and using zero-copy NIC access, we drive
              ZMap to nearly the maximum throughput of 10 gigabit Ethernet,
              almost 15 million probes per second.  With these changes, ZMap can
              comprehensively scan for a single TCP port across the entire public
              IPv4 address space in 4.5 minutes given adequate upstream
              bandwidth.  We consider the implications of such rapid scanning for
              both defenders and attackers, and we briefly discuss a range of
              potential applications.</p>

              <p>Zakir Durumeric, David Adrian, Ariana Mirian, Michael Bailey, J. Alex Halderman<br/>
              22nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS'15)</p>

              <p class="abstract">Fast Internet-wide scanning has opened new
              avenues for security research, ranging from uncovering widespread
              vulnerabilities in random number generators to tracking the
              evolving impact of Heartbleed. However, this technique still
              requires significant effort: even simple questions, such as, "What
              models of embedded devices prefer CBC ciphers?", require developing
              an application scanner, manually identifying and tagging devices,
              negotiating with network administrators, and responding to abuse
              complaints. In this paper, we introduce Censys, a public search
              engine and data processing facility backed by data collected from
              ongoing Internet-wide scans. Designed to help researchers answer
              security-related questions, Censys supports full-text searches on
              protocol banners and querying a wide range of derived fields (e.g.,
              443.https.cipher). It can identify specific vulnerable devices and
              networks and generate statistical reports on broad usage patterns
              and trends. Censys returns these results in sub-second time,
              dramatically reducing the effort of understanding the hosts that
              comprise the Internet. We present the search engine architecture
              and experimentally evaluate its performance. We also explore
              Censys's applications and show how recent questions become simple
              to answer.</p>
